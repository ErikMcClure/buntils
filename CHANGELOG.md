- Removed `cObjSwap`
- Fixed CompTSecond to actually use second type
- Added `cTrie`
- Changed `cBinaryHeap` to default to a maxheap using CompT rather than a minheap so HeapSort sorts things in ascending order by default (and so this behavior is consistent with the std heap implementation). `cScheduler` was modified to account for this, but `cPriorityQueue` now has inverted default behavior.
- Renamed `cUniquePtr.h` to `cSmartPtr.h`, removed `cUniquePtr` and added `cAutoRef`
- Removed `cSparseArray.h`
- Changed several `Size()` calls to Capacity to prevent accidents
- `bun_algo.h` now contains an implementation of Robert Bridson's Fast Poisson Disk Sampling algorithm and an SSE2 optimized 4x4 matrix multiplier.

- Dropped support for command line arguments in `cSetting` (use updated `cCmdLineArgs` instead) and massively simplified the implementation
- Fixed `cBitArray` and added tests, standardizing the bit reference object and introducing `T_SETBIT` or `bunSetBit()` as a standard way to flip a bit.
- Added functional command line processing to `cCmdLineArgs`, along with the option of overloading the default command line parsing with a string.
- Removed fFastDoubleRound and it's siblings, changed fFastRound to always use SSE2 instructions because they're faster, added fFastTruncate using SSE2 instructions (but if your compiler isn't stupid, it should use SSE automatically)

- Added bun_util.rc so windows builds contain version/copyright information.
- Version numbers are now #define'd in `bun_defines.h` and pasted into the version number struct

- `cCmdLineArgs` now always parses unicode windows arguments and puts them into a UTF-8 encoded string.

## 0.3.83
- Added `ForceWin64Crash()`, which is a function that shouldn't exist but is necessary to prevent 64-bit Windows 7 from pretending crashes that occur over a kernal barrier never happened, which causes undefined, insanely weird and unpredictable behavior.
- Fixed the project to throw on Win32 errors to bypass AFX stack corruption bugs in the debugger.
- Changed how `cAllocTracker` works
- Optimized `cAllocTracker` so that, if using the default allocator, it uses no memory.
- Improved lambda handling
- Removed [] from `cBitField` because of all the conflicts it created

- Standardized function pointer calls to use less ambiguous syntax in certain functions
- Fixed broken algorithm in binsearch_exact and added unit tests.
- Added __restrict to UTF8 conversion functions because they explode if output==input anyway.

- Added atomic_xchg
- x64 compile now passes all tests
- _trimpath more efficient
- log times now work properly and don't give negative hours
- `cObjSwap` no longer uses Traits (which is a good thing because it would have exploded the instant someone tried using reference traits in it)
- Added sseVec for safe SSE optimized vector operations.
- Added tests for object-based `cObjSwap` and sseVec.
- `cKhash` now supports move semantics on insert and setvalue, and no longer uses Traits

- Renamed `cFixedChunkAlloc` to `cFixedAlloc`
- Fixed compile crash when using DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALLOCATORS
- Reorganized source folder

- `cINIstorage` split into `cINIstorage.h`, `cINIsection.h`, `cINIentry.h`, and accompanying *.cpp files
- `cINIstorage` is now a linked list with significantly less overhead for handling unique section and entry IDs.
- Added `Front()` and `Back()` to `cArrayWrap`
- Adjusted `cArraySimple` to avoid allocating an array in a constructor if its given an initial size of 0, which can be very valuable when you need to avoid `malloc()` hits.
-! Swapped keyinstance and secinstance in `cINIstorage` EditEntry to make it consistent with GetEntry.
- `cStrT`::SetSize has been removed and `cStrT`::StripChar actually does what it says it does
- `cStrT`::Recal`cSize` is no longer capable of touching memory that was reserved and modified. If you were using this before with `reserve()`, you should switch to `resize()`.
- Removed using namespace std; from `StreamSplitter` and fixed broken namespace references
- `StreamSplitter`, `bun_Log`, and `bun_debuginfo` now only have move semantics. For GCC, `StreamSplitter` has NO move or copy constructors (because stream_buf doesn't).

- Changed 32bit/64bit to specific architectures.
- There is now a 64BIT flag that should be used only when you need to know the pointer size, not when using architecture specific assembly
- `cLocklessQueue` is now `cLocklessByteQueue`
- Adjusted `cKhash`, which now properly handles hash sets
- `cAVL_Tree` now uses standard old-style functors
- Fixed fsmall and added dsmall
- `VERSION_INFO.Patch` is now `VERSION_INFO.Revision`
- `test.exe` is now a comprehensive set of unit tests
- `cAutoPtr.h` now modifies unique_ptr to be easier to use (this can be turned off)
- Custom allocators now verify deallocated pointers and fill them with junk values when possible in debug mode
- All custom allocators using the `Allocator` class can be disabled by defining `BSS_DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALLOCATORS`. This is useful if a custom allocator does not fill deallocations with junk, or if the junk filling is insufficient, resulting in an invalid memory access bug being masked. Many compilers also have special hooks for detecting out of bounds memory accesses that only work with the default allocation routines.
- Rewrote `cBinaryHeap`
- Added bunreverse
- removed `cVect.h`
- Changed `cAutoPtr` to `cUniquePtr`
- Refactored the entire Compare methodology and introduced methods of doing only LT and GT comparisons.
- Created `bun_algo.h` and moved `shuffle()` to it.
- added `for_all()`
- added binsearch_near and variants
- Implemented library wide utf8 decoding. Most wchar_t implementations remain, but all char* functions are translated to wchar_t internally. If you happen to recieve strings in wchar_t format, this allows you to avoid unnecessary encoding/decoding while still ensuring all text is utf8 enabled. You should #define _UNICODE in your application if you want to enforce unicode compatability. `cStr` conversion between `cStr` <-> `cStrW` use unicode encoder/decoders, so unicode information is always preserved.
- Removed wchar_t specialization from `cINIstorage` and certain other things. You can no longer output to a wostream - instead, all output will be utf8 encoded.
- Removed `Iterator.h` and standardized iterators for linked lists, added iterator based begin/end functions.
- Added non-standard removal specific iterator for linked lists.
- Extended compiler specific switches and available information
- Added x86_64 platform to project and configured for 64-bit compilation.
- Created workarounds for assembly based functions and removed others in x86_64, allowing bun_util to compile in x86_64
- Adjusted some x86 assembly and added `CPU_Barrier()` as an efficient way to prevent CPU re-ordering.
- Changed hash to use iterators
- Existing iterator Begin/IterStart functions renamed to `begin()` to support range-based for loops
- Added unit testing.
- Fixed extremely subtle bug in `cINIStorage` and several other bugs

## 0.3.81
- Added `CLASS_PROP_VAL` and `CLASS_PROP_WRITEONLY_VAL` for value-type class property generation
- Added smaller valued `log2()` overloads (ushort and uchar)
- Changed `cSettings` CMD parsing to simply interprete the existence of a boolean flag as setting the value to true
- Fixed a `cSettings` const char* assignment glitch
- `cSettings` now forces char values to write as numbers
- Added char values to possible conversions for `cINIEntry`
- Added `bytesearch()` function
- Fixed bizarre bug where fopen in text mode "helpfully" replaced all \n with \n\r and caused infinitely expanding newlines.
- Added generic Iterator class and linkedlist implementations
- Made header gaurds more unique
- Changed the command argument parser to return an unsigned int on size
- filesize returns an unsigned long long instead of an unsigned int
- Added SSCANF to deprecated list
- `cMap` now properly uses the Key traits
- Fixed unholy deluge of useless dll warnings spawned by `cStr`
- `cArrayConstruct` now properly copies values from other `cArrayConstruct` objects with respect to constructors
- Made `cArraySafe` which properly deconstructs and reconstructs all objects for full type safety
- `cArraySort` and `cMap` can now use any `cArraySimple`/`cArrayConstruct`/`cArraySafe` 
- Added `IsValid()` helper function to `cINIentry`
- Implemented `cAutoPtr` (modification of standard auto_ptr)
- Changed all GetSize/GetLength to just `Size()`/`Length()`
- Added `cAutoRef`
- `cObjSwap` now allows arrays
- Completely rewrote `bun_Log`
- Added `cArrayCircular`
- Added check for self-assignment to most assignment operators where necessary
- Added move semantics to all low-level objects
- Added GetBitMask and C equivelent
- Changed `cArraySimple` to require `cArrayWrap` to be accessible (reduces inheritance issues)
